How to create a release:


With Docker:
^^^^^^^^^^^

1. Create a docker image that has everything needed for building Bitfire:

 $ docker build -t bf .

2. Run this in the bitfire directory:

 $ docker run -it --rm -v `pwd`:/a -w /a bf sh -c "sh create_release.sh"

3. Delete the docker image when you don't need it anymore

 $ docker rmi bf


Without Docker:

2. Also follow instuctions in the file to create everything in $HOME/tools/acme
